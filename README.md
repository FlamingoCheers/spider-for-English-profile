This...thing is a bunch of codes that i use to grab word entries from a dictionary-ish website. I used python3, beautiful soup 4, pickle, and txteditor.
I think anyone with tiny little knowledge about python and http can understand my code here, since i basically knew nothing about them 4 days ago either.
I also uploaded the file entryUrlSet.pk. This is the list of urls of every word entry i wanted to grab, which are words/collocations of C2 level in CEFR.

因为我是一个菜鸡，四天从零基础到完成爬数据的整个过程，所以没有可执行文件，全部都是写好代码、复制到console里直接执行的。中间有爬出来存档的pk文件，我也会上传上来，如果有人想爬这个网站的其他数据，可以直接用这些url（如果你信得过我的话……）。
